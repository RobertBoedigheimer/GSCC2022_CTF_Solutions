# Physical Challenge

### Challenge
> Must be in-person (or very lucky/intuitive) to get this one. On the day of the event, find the book that contains the solution to: 53.20.3, 284.6.8, 25.9.6

Now that the pandemic has relaxed enough to make people more comfortable meeting in person, this challenge is one that cannot be solved unless you are physically present at Granite State Code Camp.

The provided link takes you to a [Wikipedia page for Benedict Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Arnold). Assuming nobody has edited it out for some reason by the time you read this, there is a subtle clue on this page. Because you are doing a Capture the Flag challenge, you will want to scour this page for anything related to security or cryptography or .... ciphers. And indeed there are two mentions of a cipher in there. A little more Googling and you will discover something called the Arnold Cipher. 

Having done the research you now know that the cipher works by identifying words in a book by their page.line.word. Even if the message is intercepted, the hacker would have to know what book was used, and then have the same edition available to inspect. 

The book used in this challenge is the *The Martian* by Andy Weir, ISBN 978-0-553-41802-6.
