# Blasteroids

### Challenge
> If you can blast all the asteroids in this Android app, you will reveal the flag

The provided link downloads an Android app. It is a game that presumably you must beat to obtain the flag:

The thing is, the game is (probably) impossible to win. It is designed to be extremely difficult to make any significant progress. With enough perseverance you may be able to uncover the letters eventually but it is not worth the effort to try.

Instead, using your knowledge of Android development and the structure of .apk files, you will simply unzip the file (yes, it is just an archive) and then look for the file that is the image hidden behind the asteroids.
