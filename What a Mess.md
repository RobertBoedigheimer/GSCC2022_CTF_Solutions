# What a Mess

### Challenge
> ![](/image/whatamess.png)

Here you are presented with something that looks like alien symbols. But actually this is a somewhat popular "cipher" known as pigpen ciper or tic tac toe cipher. The clue takes you to an image of Pig Pen, a character from Peanuts, which is intended to help you Google your way to discovering the solution.

It is not much of a cipher really, with very little effort you can decode this on sight after gaining some familiarity with the key:

The symbols represent the section of a grid and they correspond to a letter. For example, &#8896; is the letter V and &sdotb; is the letter N.
